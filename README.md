This project involved developing an NBA dashboard using SQL, Python, and Streamlit to analyze key performance metrics and business insights. The dashboard visualized trends in career longevity by position, team revenue per home win, 3-point shooting impact on game outcomes, and player draft positions. SQL queries were used to extract and process data from an NBA database, and the cleaned data was analyzed with Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib. Machine learning models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, were applied to identify metrics influencing draft positions. The dashboard provided actionable insights into player performance, team strategies, and league-wide trends, offering value to stakeholders for decision-making.
